# snowdata
Alpha Version, Very unfinished.
Problems with .net version for map implementation
#This program is made for data on snowmaking systems. This map will correspond with many different Ski Areas, to show many weather trends, and show the property of the currently select ski are property. It will also collect data on snowmaking profitablity. Depending on a matrix of different wetbult/tempature zones.
#Currently just waiting on map implementation, and then will continue on data center gatherings. My OpenWeatherMap data isn't caching but thats ok. This is a rough draft.
#Later implementation will have will have production design applications on the map. To plan out snow making production ideas. (WHAT RUNS/HYDRANTS WILL RUN) This will also be implemented into the data organization. Business data is important, and its important to know where all the water is going at one times/what days/what weather conditions.
#After those implementations we will later add a deep learning implementation with these datasets to improve snow making production and ensure that the marginal production is as profitable as we can get it.
#After this stuff, we will make edge computation devices that will help run snowguns with hydrolic controls based on windspeed and wind direction.
#As of right now, this is very unfinished but it will be continued soon. If you want to try to implement so of the features, be my guest. Much like the other repository it's unfinished and opensource as of right now.
